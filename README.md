# Confidence-Calibration-under-Distribution-Shift
This repository is dedicated to documenting state-of-the-art methods for confidence calibration of classification models under distribution shift, including papers and reproduction code for these methods. The distribution shift include three kinds: Label shift, Covariate shift, and Out-of-distribution.
